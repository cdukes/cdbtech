I cannot recommend Cooper highly enough. He’s _extremely professional_, offers a _quick turnaround_ and explains in very concise detail what he has done to enhance your project. He’s extremely _personable_ and _good value_ for money. You cannot underestimate having someone work on the finer coding details of your web project who really understands what they are doing. 10/10 in my books!
