Cooper absolutely _hit the ground running_ from Day One at the Journal, with a _fresh perspective_ and _innovative new ideas_ to use web-based tools to help us become more productive and marketable as a publication. \[…\] It’s because of people like Cooper that I’ll be forever grateful for the experience \[of managing at GJIA\].
