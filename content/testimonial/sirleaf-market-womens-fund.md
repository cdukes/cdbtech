Cooper Dukes helped the Sirleaf Market Womenâ€™s Fund distill our ideas into _practical visual concepts_ that lend simplicity to navigating our website. Very technically minded and focused, he was able to work as part of our team and respected our need to gain consensus within before taking action. We would recommend Cooper Dukes to those who are seeking a _true professional_ in the world of IT.
