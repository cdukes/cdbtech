As a web designer who has worked with Cooper on a number of projects, I _cannot recommend him enough_. What I look for first in a developer is responsiveness and capability. Cooper is _adept at his craft_, and I always think of him first when clients are in need of a website developer. The integrity of the design as it is carried through development is of the utmost importance to me, and Cooper is _incredibly attentive to detail_. He is _responsive_, _communicates clearly_ about technology and is always _solutions-oriented_. Iâ€™ve worked in the web design industry for eight years, and without a doubt I put Cooper at the top of my list of favorite tech partners.
