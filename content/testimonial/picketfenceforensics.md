Cooper did an exceptional job reformatting and designing our website. After some challenging experiences working with web designers we were thankful to find someone as _highly skilled_, _responsive_ and _easy to work with_.

We knew exactly what we wanted in terms of design and function for our site, but we didn’t know how to get there. Cooper responds to questions and concerns in a timely fashion, has _innovative ideas_ and _gets the work done_. We were _absolutely thrilled_ with the end result and continue to reap the rewards of a well-designed and very user-friendly web-site. We can’t recommend Cooper highly enough – he’s _hard-working_, _focused_ and _always professional_. Thanks for your awesome work, Cooper!
