Cooper Dukes is the _best of the best_. We feel like we discovered the _“Hope Diamond” of the development world_ when we connected with him. From our very first project, it was apparent that Cooper is not only a gifted developer, but _professional, reliable, knowledgeable and consistent_.

He is very _detail-oriented_ and provides an enormous amount of _support and expertise_. He is one of the key players adding to the success of both BASHelorette and CS Creative Suite. We would not be where we are today without Cooper, and look forward to many future collaborations in coming years. If you work with Cooper, your expectations will be exceeded – he is a _delight to work with._
