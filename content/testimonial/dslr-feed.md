I \[was\] completely impressed with \[Cooper’s\] professionalism. Also, his knowledge of web design and development were extremely obvious. \[…\] Cooper has an _amazing work ethic_, _is professional_, _respectable_, and he _genuinely cares_ about his projects. I wouldn’t only hire Cooper again, I am looking for reasons to do so.
