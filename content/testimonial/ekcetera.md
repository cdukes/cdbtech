I’ve hired Cooper several times as a contract developer for my company. He is _extremely professional_ and _thorough_. \[…\] I am _consistently pleased_ with the results of our projects. \[…\] His knowledge of the subject is exceptional and anything I’ve thrown at him has been in his _never-ending list of capabilities_. Definitely going to continue working with Cooper!
