I try to write modular code, broken down into easy to follow chunks, with clearly named functions. I try to conform to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) as much possible and create consistent, well-integrated interfaces when extending currently existing software.

The exact text/image documentation provided will vary by project. I want to make sure that my code is clear and that you’re able to use the products I create, but I don’t want to write _volumes_ unnecessarily. Please specify your documentation requirements before we get started, so I can provide you with what you need.
