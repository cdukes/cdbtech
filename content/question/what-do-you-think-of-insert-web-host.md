Probably not much. Iâ€™ve worked with dozens of hosts over the years, and most are pretty awful. Personally, I only recommend a few hosts, based on your budget/scale:

- WPEngine, for premium WordPress hosting
- DreamHost, for small sites
- Amazon Web Services, for larger implementations

For domain registration, I use and recommend Google Domains.
