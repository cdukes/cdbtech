You will need to provide site content: text, images, and videos. I can build you an amazing website, but no one will ever see it if you don’t add in the words to sell your product or service.

I can help you develop your sitemap, which will determine what pages you’ll need to provide content for, and I’ll usually upload the initial batch of content for you. I can also recommend stock image resources, and in some cases, I can provide copy writing services.

However, I truly do believe that _you_ are the person best qualified to write about what you do. I know writing content can be hard, but I discourage the use of copy writing or stock imagery services most of the time.
