I run all modules I build through the relevant validation tools. For example, I use the W3C validator for HTML, JSHint for Javascript, and Google’s PageSpeed and WebPagetest for webpage performance.

I evaluate these reports and either fix the issues flagged or explain my reasons not to (such as the validator’s rule being out of date or the performance boost not being possible on your current server).
