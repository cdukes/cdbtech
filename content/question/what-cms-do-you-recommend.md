WordPress. Easily. I’ve worked with the big three open source CMS’s (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla), as well as many of the lesser-known ones, and WordPress is absolutely the best in my opinion:

- It has a massive developer community, meaning that the code is thoroughly documented and that there’s a huge pool of knowledge to draw upon when trying to code custom functionality. This reduces development time, and makes for better solutions.
- It’s updated on a regular interval. WP releases a major update twice each year, innovating new features and improving performance on a consistent cycle.
- It’s free, both in cost and in openness. Every line of WP code is accessible to anyone who wants to look.
- It’s secure. The WP core software _very_ rarely has major security issues, and when these arise, they’re quickly patched. So long as only well-vetted themes and plugins are added to WP, the software remains secure. Most WP site hacks, as well as articles about WP’s insecurity, are the result of running outdated software.
