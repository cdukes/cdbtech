Yes, I have a general contract, applicable to any work we do together. The goal of my contract is to make sure we each understand what our responsibilities are, not to deceive you. As such, itâ€™s written in plain English and available in a version controlled [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cdukes/general-contract "General Contract") for you to review at any time.

For fixed-price work, I will also submit a project proposal, outlining the scope, timeline, and price for the individual project.
