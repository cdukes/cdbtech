I think it’s disingenuous to speak in the [royal we](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we). Although I work in teams every day and can all kinds of specialists to your project if needed, I’m one person with a company right now.

[When I have no choice](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Hire_Less_and_Hire_Later.php), I’ll hire someone. Then, I’ll find-and-replace all the _I’s_ into _we’s_. =)
