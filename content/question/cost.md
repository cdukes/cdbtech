I can keep costs low on several fronts, and pass some of that that value onto you:

1. _I build efficient processes_, time tracking everything I do (billable or not) and finding ways to do it better.
2. _I avoid excess_. My proposals are 1-3 pages, not 20-40. I don’t show up at your office when an email will do (and give you the freedom to reply at your convenience).
3. …and most importantly, _I sell the solution I believe you need_. Sometimes you don’t need a several thousand dollar custom-built system yet. I won’t try to sell that to you when a simpler implementation will do. I’d rather save you the money now so that you can invest it in your idea, grow, and _then_ come back to me for the big project.
