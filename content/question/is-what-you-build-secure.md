No site is 100% secure in all circumstances, but I do my best and am confident in the products I deliver. Security is multi-faceted issue, and I try to address every aspect, including:

- Writing secure code, with version control
- Making regular backups
- Making sure your site is on a quality web host
- Encouraging good practices, like using strong passwords and rotating credentials
- Sanitizing any user data inputs
- Using encryption as appropriate
