> I'm *Cooper Dukes*, a guy who makes cool new things on the Internet.

{{< image src="media/cooper.jpg" class="alignright" width="250" height="228" alt="Cooper Dukes">}}

**Personal Mission**: To develop systems that enable people to eschew inefficient, nonessential tasks from their businesses, activities, and lives, empowering them to pursue unencumbered creativity and change.

**Current Residence**: Durham, North Carolina

### Why?

I believe that Internet technology is about far more than computer choice or database size...

> It's about intelligently designing *thoughtful* processes around human-machine interaction.

> It's about finding *elegant* solutions to business problems, eliminating the pain of rote tasks, and nurturing healthier business practices that make work more rewarding, more productive, and more innovative.

> And it's about *understanding* how developments are *changingÂ the way we change*, creating a million new intersections between information and technology.
