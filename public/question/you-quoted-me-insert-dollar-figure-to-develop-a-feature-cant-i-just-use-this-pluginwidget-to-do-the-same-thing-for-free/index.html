<p>When was the plugin last updated? Is it currently maintained? Is the source reputable? How much customization will be required to make it fit your site? How well does it perform? It is secure?</p>

<p>Plugins may look like ideal solutions. (Who would argue with free?) However, many plugins you find online are long out of date. Even those that aren’t will often mesh poorly with your site. What’s the point of paying for a bespoke web presence when you just throw a neon green contact form into the sidebar on launch day?</p>

<p>In addition, plugins, by definition, aren’t as tightly integrated into the rest of the site as custom developed functionality. They often execute when not needed, or load extra files on every page, or just work really inefficiently.</p>

<p>Generally, I try to use as few plugins as possible (&lt;5) on the sites I design. When I do use them, I make sure that:</p>

<ol>
<li>They don’t perform a functionality I could easily code myself.</li>
<li>They’re actively developed by a reputable source.</li>
<li>They don’t excessively hinder performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, on this site I’m using Gravity Forms, WordPress SEO, and Advanced Custom Fields. That’s it.</p>
