<p>WordPress. Easily. I’ve worked with the big three open source CMS’s (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla), as well as many of the lesser-known ones, and WordPress is absolutely the best in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a massive developer community, meaning that the code is thoroughly documented and that there’s a huge pool of knowledge to draw upon when trying to code custom functionality. This reduces development time, and makes for better solutions.</li>
<li>It’s updated on a regular interval. WP releases a major update twice each year, innovating new features and improving performance on a consistent cycle.</li>
<li>It’s free, both in cost and in openness. Every line of WP code is accessible to anyone who wants to look.</li>
<li>It’s secure. The WP core software <em>very</em> rarely has major security issues, and when these arise, they’re quickly patched. So long as only well-vetted themes and plugins are added to WP, the software remains secure. Most WP site hacks, as well as articles about WP’s insecurity, are the result of running outdated software.</li>
</ul>
