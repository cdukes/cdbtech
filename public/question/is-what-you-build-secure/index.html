<p>No site is 100% secure in all circumstances, but I do my best and am confident in the products I deliver. Security is multi-faceted issue, and I try to address every aspect, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing secure code, with version control</li>
<li>Making regular backups</li>
<li>Making sure your site is on a quality web host</li>
<li>Encouraging good practices, like using strong passwords and rotating credentials</li>
<li>Sanitizing any user data inputs</li>
<li>Using encryption as appropriate</li>
</ul>
