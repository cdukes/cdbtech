<p>I can keep costs low on several fronts, and pass some of that that value onto you:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>I build efficient processes</em>, time tracking everything I do (billable or not) and finding ways to do it better.</li>
<li><em>I avoid excess</em>. My proposals are 1-3 pages, not 20-40. I don’t show up at your office when an email will do (and give you the freedom to reply at your convenience).</li>
<li>…and most importantly, <em>I sell the solution I believe you need</em>. Sometimes you don’t need a several thousand dollar custom-built system yet. I won’t try to sell that to you when a simpler implementation will do. I’d rather save you the money now so that you can invest it in your idea, grow, and <em>then</em> come back to me for the big project.</li>
</ol>
