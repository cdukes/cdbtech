<p>From my <a href="https://github.com/CDBTechLLC/general-contract">general contract</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will test any views that I build for you in the current stable version of the four major desktop browsers by market share, as well as in iOS. Users of older or less capable browsers or devices will experience a design that is appropriate to the capabilities of their software.</p>

<p>For example, as of July 21, 2018, browser coverage would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome 67 (tested), with any bugs in v66 covered</li>
<li>Firefox 61 (tested), with any bugs in v60 covered</li>
<li>Safari 11 (tested), with any bugs in v10 covered</li>
<li>iOS Safari 11 (tested on an iPad and iPhone, in portrait and landscape modes), with any bugs in v10 covered</li>
<li>Edge 42 (tested), with any bugs in v41 covered</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 11 (tested)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need me to consider other or older browsers, I will charge you at my standard hourly rate.</p>
