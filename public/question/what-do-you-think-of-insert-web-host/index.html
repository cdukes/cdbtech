<p>Probably not much. Iâ€™ve worked with dozens of hosts over the years, and most are pretty awful. Personally, I only recommend a few hosts, based on your budget/scale:</p>

<ul>
<li>WPEngine, for premium WordPress hosting</li>
<li>DreamHost, for small sites</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services, for larger implementations</li>
</ul>

<p>For domain registration, I use and recommend Google Domains.</p>
