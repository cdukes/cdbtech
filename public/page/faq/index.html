		<p>It depends. A CMS will allow you to update your website without calling me (or learning HTML), but implementing a CMS adds a lot of weight to the backend, since you’ll need to communicate with a database on every page load (caching aside). This adds extra loading time to your site, compared to just using static HTML.</p>
<p>You’ll have to ask yourself, “Will I make regular updates to this website, once it’s completed?” If you won’t, then it may be best to opt for the simpler non-CMS solution.</p>

	<div id="a-4203f50-b" class="accordion-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="a-4203f50-h">
		<p>WordPress. Easily. I’ve worked with the big three open source CMS’s (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla), as well as many of the lesser-known ones, and WordPress is absolutely the best in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a massive developer community, meaning that the code is thoroughly documented and that there’s a huge pool of knowledge to draw upon when trying to code custom functionality. This reduces development time, and makes for better solutions.</li>
<li>It’s updated on a regular interval. WP releases a major update twice each year, innovating new features and improving performance on a consistent cycle.</li>
<li>It’s free, both in cost and in openness. Every line of WP code is accessible to anyone who wants to look.</li>
<li>It’s secure. The WP core software <em>very</em> rarely has major security issues, and when these arise, they’re quickly patched. So long as only well-vetted themes and plugins are added to WP, the software remains secure. Most WP site hacks, as well as articles about WP’s insecurity, are the result of running outdated software.</li>
</ul>

				You quoted me [insert dollar figure] to develop a feature. Can&#39;t I just use this plugin/widget to do the same thing for free?

	<div id="a-485743a-b" class="accordion-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="a-485743a-h">
		<p>When was the plugin last updated? Is it currently maintained? Is the source reputable? How much customization will be required to make it fit your site? How well does it perform? It is secure?</p>
<p>Plugins may look like ideal solutions. (Who would argue with free?) However, many plugins you find online are long out of date. Even those that aren’t will often mesh poorly with your site. What’s the point of paying for a bespoke web presence when you just throw a neon green contact form into the sidebar on launch day?</p>
<p>In addition, plugins, by definition, aren’t as tightly integrated into the rest of the site as custom developed functionality. They often execute when not needed, or load extra files on every page, or just work really inefficiently.</p>
<p>Generally, I try to use as few plugins as possible (&lt;5) on the sites I design. When I do use them, I make sure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don’t perform a functionality I could easily code myself.</li>
<li>They’re actively developed by a reputable source.</li>
<li>They don’t excessively hinder performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, on this site I’m using Gravity Forms, WordPress SEO, and Advanced Custom Fields. That’s it.</p>
