<p><strong>Personal Mission</strong>: To develop systems that enable people to eschew inefficient, nonessential tasks from their businesses, activities, and lives, empowering them to pursue unencumbered creativity and change.</p>

<p><strong>Current Residence</strong>: Durham, North Carolina</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>I believe that Internet technology is about far more than computer choice or database size&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s about intelligently designing <em>thoughtful</em> processes around human-machine interaction.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about finding <em>elegant</em> solutions to business problems, eliminating the pain of rote tasks, and nurturing healthier business practices that make work more rewarding, more productive, and more innovative.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s about <em>understanding</em> how developments are <em>changingÂ the way we change</em>, creating a million new intersections between information and technology.</p>
