		<p>Cooper and his expertise have been invaluable to our organization. Despite being located halfway around the globe, he was more reliable and responsive than any other web developer we have used. He provided us with a good balance of options, both short and long term, that have allowed us to create strategic web presence as our organization grows.</p>
<p>Cooper is also one of the rare developers that doesn’t let his broad technical knowledge get in the way of clear and concise explanations. He lays out your options and is singularly focused on working with you to find the best solutions. Additionally, he is always thinking a couple of steps ahead to ensure that you are in the best position to be effective both today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Cooper worked fast, on budget and provided us with fantastic results. I couldn’t ask for anything else.</p>
