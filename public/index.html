<p><strong>Personal Mission</strong>: To develop systems that enable people to eschew inefficient, nonessential tasks from their businesses, activities, and lives, empowering them to pursue unencumbered creativity and change.</p>
<p><strong>Current Residence</strong>: Durham, North Carolina</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I believe that Internet technology is about far more than computer choice or database size&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s about intelligently designing <em>thoughtful</em> processes around human-machine interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s about finding <em>elegant</em> solutions to business problems, eliminating the pain of rote tasks, and nurturing healthier business practices that make work more rewarding, more productive, and more innovative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about <em>understanding</em> how developments are <em>changing the way we change</em>, creating a million new intersections between information and technology.</p>

					<p>I typically say that I offer <strong>Business Technology Strategy</strong> solutions in three baskets: <em>Web Development</em>, <em>Technology Consulting</em>, and <em>Technology Training</em>. The idea is that I do frontend and backend web development, and I also provide auxiliary services related to understanding your technology needs and successfully using the products I build.</p>
<p>You can read below for more details, but I think the best way to understand what I offer to see actual projects in my portfolio.</p>
<h3 id="technology-consulting">Technology Consulting</h3>
<p>Technology Consulting is about exploring your needs and constraints in order to find the right web solutions for you. The process usually begins with an initial discussion of <em>what</em> you’re trying to do, <em>why</em> you’re trying to do it, and <em>how</em> you suspect it should be done.</p>
<p>I then explore the problem in further depth, examining your current systems and researching what others have done to successfully resolve similar issues in order to make meaningful, actionable recommendations. You’ll want to consider Technology Consulting if you have questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should I structure my business’s systems to be more efficient?</li>
<li>What are cost-effective solutions to common business functions, such as email, website hosting, and accounting?</li>
<li>What is the best way to organize the flow of information throughout my company?</li>
<li>How do I design an email marketing campaign?</li>
<li>What social media should I be using? How should I be using it?</li>
<li>Should I be blogging? If so, how often and on what topics?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-development">Web Development</h3>
<p>My core Website Design expertise is with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP, and my platform of choice is WordPress, though I certainly can work with other systems. I offer the following standard website design packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hybrid Design</strong> - This is the ‘lite’ version of the design process, where we work together to find a premium theme from a third-party vendor. I use this as the starting point for your website and make the necessary visual and functionality modifications to deliver a quality product that does what you need. <em>Great for small businesses who are just getting started online or individuals looking for a portfolio site.</em></li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Design</strong> - These projects follow the full design process. We explore your web needs, create original graphic mockups, code the site in a robust framework, and work to develop content. Your input is sought at every step of the process. <em>Great for businesses who already have a website but are looking to upgrade.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mockup to Web Conversion</strong> - Already have a mock-up of the site you want from your own design team? I can turn your Photoshop file into an HTML website or WordPress theme.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Port</strong> (WordPress only) - Is your site using an older WordPress theme and just not running well anymore? Do you want to keep the look mostly intact, but make some visual upgrades, too? I can take your current theme and transfer it to a modern WordPress framework, such as WooTheme’s Canvas or StudioPress’s Genesis. This is a good way to give new life to your site without the hands-on time or cost of a full redesign. The code will be new and future-proof, but the site itself will look familiar.</li>
<li><strong>Microsite</strong> - This is a basic informational website (usually between one and five pages). Perfect for a splash page for an event, a ‘coming soon’ page preceding a product or full site launch, or a company without much content. Can be implemented as a static HTML page, or incorporated with a content management system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technology-training">Technology Training</h3>
<p>You may have the best technology infrastructure money can buy, but you’ll never utilize its full potential if you lack the proper Technology Training to use it. I offer one-on-one tutoring, small group training sessions, and workshops on a variety of technologies and topics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Idea to Prototype: Getting Your Company Started on the Web</li>
<li>WordPress for Marketers</li>
<li>WordPress for Webmasters</li>
<li>Web Content Development (including SEO best practices)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also provide documentation services.</p>

		<p>Cooper and his expertise have been invaluable to our organization. Despite being located halfway around the globe, he was more reliable and responsive than any other web developer we have used. He provided us with a good balance of options, both short and long term, that have allowed us to create strategic web presence as our organization grows.</p>
<p>Cooper is also one of the rare developers that doesn’t let his broad technical knowledge get in the way of clear and concise explanations. He lays out your options and is singularly focused on working with you to find the best solutions. Additionally, he is always thinking a couple of steps ahead to ensure that you are in the best position to be effective both today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Cooper worked fast, on budget and provided us with fantastic results. I couldn’t ask for anything else.</p>

		<p>It depends. A CMS will allow you to update your website without calling me (or learning HTML), but implementing a CMS adds a lot of weight to the backend, since you’ll need to communicate with a database on every page load (caching aside). This adds extra loading time to your site, compared to just using static HTML.</p>
<p>You’ll have to ask yourself, “Will I make regular updates to this website, once it’s completed?” If you won’t, then it may be best to opt for the simpler non-CMS solution.</p>

		<p>WordPress. Easily. I’ve worked with the big three open source CMS’s (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla), as well as many of the lesser-known ones, and WordPress is absolutely the best in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a massive developer community, meaning that the code is thoroughly documented and that there’s a huge pool of knowledge to draw upon when trying to code custom functionality. This reduces development time, and makes for better solutions.</li>
<li>It’s updated on a regular interval. WP releases a major update twice each year, innovating new features and improving performance on a consistent cycle.</li>
<li>It’s free, both in cost and in openness. Every line of WP code is accessible to anyone who wants to look.</li>
<li>It’s secure. The WP core software <em>very</em> rarely has major security issues, and when these arise, they’re quickly patched. So long as only well-vetted themes and plugins are added to WP, the software remains secure. Most WP site hacks, as well as articles about WP’s insecurity, are the result of running outdated software.</li>

		<p>When was the plugin last updated? Is it currently maintained? Is the source reputable? How much customization will be required to make it fit your site? How well does it perform? It is secure?</p>
<p>Plugins may look like ideal solutions. (Who would argue with free?) However, many plugins you find online are long out of date. Even those that aren’t will often mesh poorly with your site. What’s the point of paying for a bespoke web presence when you just throw a neon green contact form into the sidebar on launch day?</p>
<p>In addition, plugins, by definition, aren’t as tightly integrated into the rest of the site as custom developed functionality. They often execute when not needed, or load extra files on every page, or just work really inefficiently.</p>
<p>Generally, I try to use as few plugins as possible (&lt;5) on the sites I design. When I do use them, I make sure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don’t perform a functionality I could easily code myself.</li>
<li>They’re actively developed by a reputable source.</li>
<li>They don’t excessively hinder performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, on this site I’m using Gravity Forms, WordPress SEO, and Advanced Custom Fields. That’s it.</p>
