<p>I [was] completely impressed with [Cooper’s] professionalism. Also, his knowledge of web design and development were extremely obvious. […] Cooper has an <em>amazing work ethic</em>, <em>is professional</em>, <em>respectable</em>, and he <em>genuinely cares</em> about his projects. I wouldn’t only hire Cooper again, I am looking for reasons to do so.</p>
