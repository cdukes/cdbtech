<p>Cooper Dukes is the <em>best of the best</em>. We feel like we discovered the <em>“Hope Diamond” of the development world</em> when we connected with him. From our very first project, it was apparent that Cooper is not only a gifted developer, but <em>professional, reliable, knowledgeable and consistent</em>.</p>
<p>He is very <em>detail-oriented</em> and provides an enormous amount of <em>support and expertise</em>. He is one of the key players adding to the success of both BASHelorette and CS Creative Suite. We would not be where we are today without Cooper, and look forward to many future collaborations in coming years. If you work with Cooper, your expectations will be exceeded – he is a <em>delight to work with.</em></p>
