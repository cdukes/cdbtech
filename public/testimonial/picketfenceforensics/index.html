<p>Cooper did an exceptional job reformatting and designing our website. After some challenging experiences working with web designers we were thankful to find someone as <em>highly skilled</em>, <em>responsive</em> and <em>easy to work with</em>.</p>
<p>We knew exactly what we wanted in terms of design and function for our site, but we didn’t know how to get there. Cooper responds to questions and concerns in a timely fashion, has <em>innovative ideas</em> and <em>gets the work done</em>. We were <em>absolutely thrilled</em> with the end result and continue to reap the rewards of a well-designed and very user-friendly web-site. We can’t recommend Cooper highly enough – he’s <em>hard-working</em>, <em>focused</em> and <em>always professional</em>. Thanks for your awesome work, Cooper!</p>
