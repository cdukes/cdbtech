<p>I’ve hired Cooper several times as a contract developer for my company. He is <em>extremely professional</em> and <em>thorough</em>. […] I am <em>consistently pleased</em> with the results of our projects. […] His knowledge of the subject is exceptional and anything I’ve thrown at him has been in his <em>never-ending list of capabilities</em>. Definitely going to continue working with Cooper!</p>
