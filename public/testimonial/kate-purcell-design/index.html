<p>As a web designer who has worked with Cooper on a number of projects, I <em>cannot recommend him enough</em>. What I look for first in a developer is responsiveness and capability. Cooper is <em>adept at his craft</em>, and I always think of him first when clients are in need of a website developer. The integrity of the design as it is carried through development is of the utmost importance to me, and Cooper is <em>incredibly attentive to detail</em>. He is <em>responsive</em>, <em>communicates clearly</em> about technology and is always <em>solutions-oriented</em>. Iâ€™ve worked in the web design industry for eight years, and without a doubt I put Cooper at the top of my list of favorite tech partners.</p>
